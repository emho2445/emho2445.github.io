    <h2 class="Assignment 1">Lab 1: Simple Circuits</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For this lab I explored the concepts of electrical components in series and in parallel. 
        This was also an introductory lab to using a breadboard to connect electrical components. 
        I created a circuit that used resistors, and LED and button to light up the LEDs. </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <p>For this lab I used the following materials from my Arduino Uno Starter Kit: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Power Supply Module</li>
        <li>Button</li>
        <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
        <li>Breadboard Jumper Wires</li>
        <li>9V Battery with Snap-on Connector Clip</li>
        <li>100 ohm Resistors</li>
        <li>LED</li>
        <li>Multimeter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step in this lab was to set up power to the breadboard. I attached the power supply module to the breadboard so that
            one column of the board would be 5 volts and the other side would be 3.3 volts. Below are pictures of the multimeter reading out 5 
            volts and on the other side 3.3 volts: <br>

            <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/5VoltReading.jpg" alt="5 Volt Reading">
        </li> <br>

        <li>Next I created a simple circuit that consisted of a 9 volt battery, a 100 ohm resistor, a blue LED and wires to connect them.
             For this circuit I used the 3.3V side of the breadboard. <br>

             <!-- Insert image of simple circuit and schematic -->
        </li><br>

        <li>Next I created the same simple circuit but used the 5 volt source. Since the voltage was higher I needed to use a different 
            resistor to make sure the current was within range. I found that the resistor needs to be at least ______ ohms so I just used 
            two 100 ohm resistors in series with each other. <br>

            <!-- Insert image from the 5 volt side with equations --> 
        </li><br>

        <li>
            After this I incorporated a momentary switch into the circuit in series with the LED and resistor. When adding the button the 
            LED will only turn on when the button is pressed. This is because the button creates a break in the circuit when not pressed, 
            this does not allow current to flow. When the button is pressed the circuit is connected and current can flow freely. <br>

            </video>
        </li><br>

        <li>For the extra credit assignment we had to get the button to work in reverse: the light turned off when the button was pressed. 
            To do this I made the button and LED in parallel with each other. The 100 ohm resistor is in series with each loop in the parallel 
            circuit so that no matter which direction current flows it has to go through the resistor. The reason that the button works opposite 
            from when it was in series is because of the way current flows through parallel circuits. The LED can be thought of as a very small 
            resistor in a circuit. The button, when pressed, can be thought of as a wire with negligible resistance. When current gets to the junction 
            where it either goes to the LED (acting like a resistor) or through the button (acting like a wire) it chooses the “path of least resistance” 
            and the current goes through the button instead of the branch with the LED. When the button is not pressed then that loop is a broken circuit 
            and no current can flow through that branch causing all of it to go to the LED. <br>
