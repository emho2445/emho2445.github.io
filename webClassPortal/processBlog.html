    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 1</h3>
    <h4>September 6, 2023 </h4>

    <p>
        I am going to host my Class Portal on my portfolio website. I started this website about a year ago and my goal is to have it be 
        something I can showcase that shows both my web development abilities and the other technical projects that I have worked on. 
        As shown on the first page of the wireframe below, this portal is going to be located under “Class Blogs” since I have several 
        classes that need a blog-like portfolio. Within the class portal I plan to have four different pages, Main, Projects, Assignments 
        and Process Blog. Each of these pages can be seen on pages 2-9 wireframe. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On each wireframe page I created boxes that outline the general location of the information. I do not plan to have each item in a 
        box with borders but the boxes help me visualize the space on the page which content will be confined to. I am also going to have to 
        learn about how to create the drop-down menu style since that is not currently implemented in this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main page of the Class Portal will have three buttons at the top of it that link out to the other pages where the assignments, 
        projects and blog posts are going to be turned in. This page is also intended to give context to a potential employer or someone 
        without knowledge of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        My portfolio has an overall minimalist appearance to it that I plan to keep. I want to keep readers focused on the content without 
        a lot of distractions on the page. Something that I want to improve as far as layout is image sizing. I always feel that my images 
        are either too big and break up the text too much or are too small to see all of the details.

    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 2</h3>
    <h4>September 19, 2023 </h4>

    <p>
        I started this Class Portal with a solid foundation from my portfolio website. I started by creating a new page that represents the 
        home page for the class portal and linking that to the navigation bar at the top of the website. From that home page I created more 
        pages that link out to the three different pages for the Class Portal: Projects, Assignments and Process Blog.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I wanted to create a drop down menu for the separate pages on the navigation bar. Unfortunately I ran into a lot of issues with that. 
        I am continuing to troubleshoot that as I still plan to implement the drop down. I think that I was defining the navigation bar incorrectly. 
        Since I was really sick all last week I did not have as much time as I needed to debug this to get it working. Therefore, it will be a late 
        implementation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to continue to play around with the Home Page for this portal. Once I get some assignments and projects I want to make the buttons 
        images that represent the types of projects on that page. This concept can kind of be seen on the wireframe from Milestone 1. In the meantime I 
        played around with some of the <em>flex</em> properties we learned about in class. I have previously only used grid so I am going to be changing everything 
        over to flex.
