    <h2>Favorite Object</h2>
    <p>My favorite object is one that I've had since before I can remember. Her name is Kitty Kitty. She is a small, tan, stuffed
        cat wearing a neutral beige onesie. She is made out of a fuzzy, fur-like cloth with textured cloth clothes.
        Ever since I was little I remember playing with her outfit as the back of the onesie opens and you can take the tail in and out.
        She is special to me because she was always the toy I would go to when I was extremely happy or upset. She's traveled the world
        with me on vacations and is the only toy/stuffed animal I've brought to college. Whenever I need some comfort she is there for me.
