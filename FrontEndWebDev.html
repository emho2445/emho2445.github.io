    <!-- Entry 1: Class Portal Milestone 1 -->
    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 1</h3>

    <p>
        I am going to host my Class Portal on my portfolio website. I started this website about a year ago and my goal is to have it be 
        something I can showcase that shows both my web development abilities and the other technical projects that I have worked on. 
        As shown on the first page of the wireframe below, this portal is going to be located under “Class Blogs” since I have several 
        classes that need a blog-like portfolio. Within the class portal I plan to have four different pages, Main, Projects, Assignments 
        and Process Blog. Each of these pages can be seen on pages 2-9 wireframe. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On each wireframe page I created boxes that outline the general location of the information. I do not plan to have each item in a 
        box with borders but the boxes help me visualize the space on the page which content will be confined to. I am also going to have to 
        learn about how to create the drop-down menu style since that is not currently implemented in this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main page of the Class Portal will have three buttons at the top of it that link out to the other pages where the assignments, 
        projects and blog posts are going to be turned in. This page is also intended to give context to a potential employer or someone 
        without knowledge of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        My portfolio has an overall minimalist appearance to it that I plan to keep. I want to keep readers focused on the content without 
        a lot of distractions on the page. Something that I want to improve as far as layout is image sizing. I always feel that my images 
        are either too big and break up the text too much or are too small to see all of the details.
