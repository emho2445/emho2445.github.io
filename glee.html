    <h2>Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone</h2>
    <h4>( GLEE )</h4>
    
    <div>
        
        <p>GLEE is a mission to land hundreds of LunaSats (small spacecraft about the size of 
            a Post-it note) on the Moon to conduct citizen science missions. GLEE is led by NASA’s 
            Colorado Space Grant Consortium at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and is currently 
            supported by NASA’s Artemis Student Challenges.
        </p>
        <p>GLEE’s goal is to engage students around the world by giving them the opportunity to work
             with hardware and code developing skills and a possible science mission. We are working 
             towards securing a ride to the Moon. Our workshop teams will know as soon as our flight 
             is confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>I was hired to GLEE in September of 2020 and have played a huge role in the creation and execution 
            of the GLEE Remote Workshop. As the Communications and Public Outreach Team Lead, my role included 
            creating the 10 hands-on learning modules that teams use to learn about the LunaSat.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/lunasat.jpg" alt="LunaSat" id="lunasat">
        <p>The LunaSat has 5 scientific sensors along with a radio frequency and power management system. During 
            the workshop teams get to learn about these different sensors so at the end they can create their own 
            mission case. Our hope is to one day send up over 200 LunaSats and collect distributive science on the 
            lunar surface. 
        </p>
        <p>Once the educational content was created I worked on outreach to get our student teams from across
             the world. This included creating the entire application process and selecting our student teams. 
             As of now we have 1,234 students. We have also re-opened applications for teams in the Artemis Accords
              countries. I am currently working with all of our teams to help support them through the workshop. 
        </p>
        <p>As the workshop is underway, our team is currently transitioning our focus. My subteam is now working on 
            contacting lander companies to secure a ride to the moon. Our Housing and Deployment Module team has been working
             hard to create a structure that can distribute the LunaSats on the surface of the moon.
