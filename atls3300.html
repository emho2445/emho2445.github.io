    <h2 id="Assignment6">Lab 6: Motors</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this lab I explore how to use the DC Motor and the Servo motor with the power supply module and the Arduino.</p>

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
        <li>USB Cable</li>
        <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
        <li>Power Supply Module</li>
        <li>9V Battery</li>
        <li>Servo Motor</li>
        <li>DC Motor</li>
        <li>L293D Motor Driver</li>
        <li>10k Ohm Potentiometer</li>
        <li>Breadboard Jumper Wire (Male to Male)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <h4>Part 0: Setting Up Power</h4>
    <p>In this lab I am going to be powering my circuit with the power supply module. This is because the 
        motors are going to be drawing much more power than the Arduino board/pins can provide. By using the 
        9V battery I am less likely to fry my board and USB port in my computer. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part0.JPG" alt="Power Supply Module Connection">

    <h3>Part 1: Wiring The Servo</h3>
    <p>The first motor that I connected was the servo motor. This motor connects to one of the pwm pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11). 
        I connected my servo motor to pin 9 as seen below.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part1Circuit.JPG" alt="Servo Motor Circuit">

    <p>Next I installed the Servo library in my Arduino IDE by going to Library Manger and searching for “servo”.</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part1Library.png" alt="Servo Library Installed">

    <p>Using this library I used the sketch in the lab assignment to move the motor arm between 0 and 180 degrees!</p>

        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part1Sweeping.MOV">
    </video>
    
    <h4>Part 2: Controlling The Servo</h4>
    <p>In this part of the lab I wanted to control the movement of the servo motor with a potentiometer. I connected the potentiometer to pin A0. </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part2Circuit.JPG" alt="Potentiometer Connected">

    <p>To move the motor in sync with the potentiometer I used the <strong>map()</strong> function to change the range on the 
        potentiometer to be from 0-180 instead of 0-1023. Below is the sketch I used to carry out this task. 
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/0843f5a3b7f2b54c4a220a59cd84e0f9.js"></script>

        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part2Mimic.MOV">
    </video>

    <p>Next, I changed it so the potentiometer controls the speed at which the motor rotates. To do this I used the sweeping sketch from 
        Part 1 and inside each of the for loops I created an int that made the delay between 5ms and 50ms. I used the <strong>map()</strong> 
        function for this as well. 
    </p>

        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part2Speed.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 3: DC Motor and Motor Driver</h4>
    <p>Next I used the DC motor to create a different circuit. When connected to the power supply module the motor turns on.</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part3Circuit1.JPG" alt="DC Motor Connected">
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="DC Motor Fan On">
        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part3FanOn.MOV">
    </video>

    <p>Since the motor can move in either direction depending on the flow of current, we need to use a motor driver to control which way 
        the current goes through the motor. This is done using the L293D motor driver. Below is a picture of the set-up. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part3Circuit2.JPG" alt="Motor Driver Connected">

    <p>We can use the Arduino to control which parts of the motor driver are on and which parts are off. Below is the code 
        for switching the direction of current in the motor. 
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/7c23cf745fc36b86f8164e92aea13bc2.js"></script>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="DC Motor Fan Switch Directions">
        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part3Switch.mov">
    </video>

    <p>Next I modified the code to control how fast the fan spun. I used the <strong>analogWrite()</strong> function in a for-loop 
        to change the duty cycle on the speed control pin (8 on the L293D and pin 5 on the Arduino). In the <strong>rampUp()</strong> 
        function I increased the duty cycle on the pwm pin and in the <strong>rampDown()</strong> function I decreased the duty cycle 
        until the fan stopped. Below is the code and video. 
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/195f10e45552ac006687f8ba22e3e404.js"></script>

        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part3Speed.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 4: Table-Top Fan</h4>

    <p>For part 4 I am going to use both the servo motor and the DC motor to create an oscillating table-top fan. 
        First I attached the DC motor to the top of the servo motor as seen below.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part4Attach.JPG" alt="Servo Motor and DC Motor Connected">

    <p>Next, I need to add the servo motor back to my circuit. I kept the same DC motor circuit as in Part 4 and added the servo to pin 11. </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab6/Lab6Part4Circuit.JPG" alt="Servo Motor and DC Motor Circuit">

    <p>To control both motors I used the Arduino sketch below. In the loop function it sets a constant rate of 
        the DC fan by setting the pwm value to 180 which is about 70% of 255. Then it uses the same loops from 
        Part 1 to make the servo go in a sweeping motion. The code is commented to help understand. 
    </p>

    <!-- Lab 5 -->
    <h2 id="Assignment5">Lab 5: Analog Output</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this lab I use <strong>analogWrite</strong> to use the pwm (pulse width modulation) pins to analogWrite 
    different values to both an LED and passive speaker.</p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
        <li>USB Cable</li>
        <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
        <li>220 ohm Resistors</li>
        <li>RGB LED</li>
        <li>Passive Speaker</li>
        <li>Joystick Module</li>
        <li>Breadboard Jumper Wire (Male to Male and Male to Female)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Wiring Up the RGB LED</h4>
    <p>To start I created a circuit that hooked up the RGB LED to the board. 
        This LED has four prongs, ground, red, blue and green. Each RGB prong on the LED went into a pwm pin on the digital side of the arduino elegoo. 
    </p>

    <p>For this circuit I used the 220 ohm resistors for each since each prong is the same as the previous LED circuits that we used. This calculation was performed in Lab 1, step 3 for reference. 
        Below is a picture of the circuit along with a schematic of the circuit. Note that there is another prong on the LED that goes to ground.
    </p>

    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Lab5-Part1Circuit.JPG" alt="RGB Circuit">
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Lab5Part1Fritzing.png" alt="Fritzing Schematic">

    <p>Next I created a sketch that would change the color of the LED using <strong>analogWrite()</strong>. Below is the commented code on how this sketch works. </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/443f356a3fb2fa89085d1e6e212eeefe.js"></script>

    <p>I created the following colors using values for RGB respectively: </p>
    <p>Pink: (255, 10, 100)</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Part1PinkLED.JPG" alt="Pink LED">
    <p>Teal: (0, 200, 100)</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Part1TealLED.JPG" alt="Teal LED">
    <p>Greenish: (255, 200, 100)</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Part1GreenLED.JPG" alt="Green LED">
    <p>Royal Blue: (10, 10, 100)</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Part1BlueLED.JPG" alt="Blue LED">

    <h4>Part 2: Dynamic Color Changer with Joystick</h4>

    <p>In this section I wanted to change the color of the LED with the joystick from Lab 4. To do this I hooked up the joystick to the two analog pins A0 and A1. 
        Then using the <strong>map()</strong> function I was able to map the potentiometer values (0-1023) to RGB values (0-255). Then using <strong>analogWrite()</strong> 
        I was able to use the input from the joystick to write out different values for the pins. Since there are only two potentiometers and three colors I set green to be a 
        constant value so the joystick was only changing the red and blue values. I could have used <strong>random()</strong> to create a different value for green each time the 
        loop ran but that would create a flashing effect that I didn't want. 
    </p>

    </video>


    <h4>Part 3: Musical Notes With Passive Buzzer</h4>

    <p>In this part we are introducing a new component, the passive speaker. The speaker was set up so the positive side of the buzzer connected to pin 5 (a pwm pin) 
        and the other side was connected to ground. Below is a photo of the circuit. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Part3Circuit.JPG" alt="Blue LED">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/9a06fea041e0b321bb58b05d4d961e3a.js"></script>

    <p>Next I created the following arduino sketch that turns the buzzer on for one second and then off for one second. To do this I used the function <strong>tone()</strong> 
        to set the frequency of the buzzer to 440 Hz and then <strong>noTone</strong> to turn it off.
    </p>
    <video controls="controls" width="800" height="500" name="Potentiometer Circuit">
        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab5/Part3Buzzer.MOV">
    </video> 
    
    <p>To play different notes I included a pitches.h file that defines all of the different notes. It is in the same folder as the Part 3 code so that the Part 3 file can access the .h file.</p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab5/Lab5-Part3ArduinoPitches.png" alt="pitches.h">
    
    <p>I decided to play the DS3 note with a frequency of 156 Hz from the pitches file. </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/d7cab58ea04c2ed7d0ccd7ffe6f9d3c6.js"></script>
    <video controls="controls" width="800" height="500" name="Potentiometer Circuit">
        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab5/Part3BuzzerLow.MOV">
    </video>
    
    <h4>Part 4: Melody From The Buzzer</h4>

    <p>Now that I can draw from the pitches.h file to get many different notes I created the Star Wars Imperial March song with the notes and durations given by the assignment. </p>
    <p>I created different arrays, one stored the note value, the next stored the duration of the note, and then a boolean array of if it was a dotted note or not. Note that the durations that 
        I stored were what the whole note should be divided by to get the correct length.
    </p>
    <p>Then I called a for loop that loops through all of these arrays for each note. Below is the code, commented so you can follow along and a video after of what it created.</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/f190115d82185350b588ffa17311b309.js"></script>
    <video controls="controls" width="800" height="500" name="Potentiometer Circuit">
        <source src="./img/objectlab/Lab5/Part4Imperial.MOV">
    </video>

    <p>Next I created my own song using the same concepts. I decided to do a simple version of Amazing Grace. Below is the table of the notes. </p>

    <p>Using this information and the same coding concepts as above I created the song in Arduino. </p>

    <!-- Lab 4 -->
    <h2 id="Assignment4">Lab 4: Analog Input</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this lab I experiment with the analog pins on the Arduino Uno by using a potentiometer.
        I use a combination of analog and digital pins on the board to create LEDs that respond to different inputs from the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
        <li>USB Cable</li>
        <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
        <li>220 ohm Resistors</li>
        <li>LEDs</li>
        <li>Potentiometer (10k)</li>
        <li>Joystick Module</li>
        <li>Breadboard Jumper Wire (Male to Male and Male to Female)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Using a Potentiometer</h4>
    <p>For the first part of this lab I set up a circuit with the Arduino Uno and a potentiometer. 
        I used Lecture 5, slide 19 to set up this circuit. Below is a photo of the circuit and a schematic of it as well.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part1_Circuit.jpeg" alt="Schematic">
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part1_ActualCircuit.JPG" alt="Physical Circuit">
    <p>Next I used the Arduino IDE to program a sketch that reads out the analog values of the potentiometer. 
        The values for our potentiometer are going to be between 0 and 1023. I used the function <strong>analogRead()</strong> of 
        the pin to get the correct values. 
    </p>

    </video>

    <h4>Part 2: Light 'em Up With A Potentiometer</h4>
    <p>For the next step in this lab I created a breadboard with five different LED circuits and the same circuit with the potentiometer. 
        The goal is to have a different number of LED lights turn on depending on the range of the potentiometer. Below is a photo of the 
        circuit used in this part. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part2_circuit.JPG" alt="LED Circuit">
    <p>To make the code easier to understand I used the <strong>map()</strong> function to map the analog values of the potentiometer to 
        6 different states (since we have five LEDs and the off state). You can see this in line 30 of the code below. Then I used a series 
        of if, else if statements to output the correct pins that will turn on the correct number of LEDs.
    </p>

    <h4>Part 3: Joystick For Arduino</h4>
    <p>Now I am going to hook up a joystick to the Arduino. This joystick has two different potentiometers and a push button. To hook it up to the 
        Arduino Uno I used male to female wires and plugged it into the 5V, ground, A0, A1 and digital 9 pin. Below is the circuit with the joystick attached.

    <p>To see what the readings are on the joystick I created an Arduino sketch to see what it was outputting. I used the <strong>analogRead()</strong> 
        function to get the value of the analog pin in the loop. When the joystick is in the following positions it gives the following outputs formatted like (x,y): 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Centered: (495, 515)</li>
        <li>Left: (0, 515)</li>

        <li>Down to the Right: (1023, 1023)</li>
        <li>Down to the Left: (0, 1023)</li>

    <h4>Part 4: Light 'em Up With a Joystick</h4>
    <p>In this part I kept the joystick and rearranged the LED circuits so that they would be in the shape of a plus (+). Each LED is still connected to a 
        digital pin on the Arduino Uno. Below is a photo of the breadboard and circuit. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part4_Circuit.JPG" alt="Joystick LED Circuit">
    <p>Next, I wanted to turn on the LED corresponding to the direction of the joystick. For my circuit I wanted the white one in the center on if the joystick 
        was at rest, the red one on when the joystick was pushed up, green for the right, yellow for down and blue for the left. To do this I needed to create 
        different conditions for the different joystick positions. I mapped the x and y potentiometer analog readings between -2 and 2 for the different positions. 
        Then I used a series of if-statements to test which direction the joystick was. If the condition was met then the LED corresponding to the position would turn on. 
        The code below is commented as well so you can follow along with it.

    <h4>Part 5: Basic LED Whack-A-Mole</h4>
    <p>For the final part of this lab I put all of the above concepts together to create a whack-a-mole style game with LEDs! First I created the user interface by 
        printing out “Get Ready!” and blinking the center LED twice. From there I put the code in a for loop that will run 20 times to create 20 rounds in the game and started a timer.
    </p>
    <p>I needed to create a boolean value to see if the LED in the game is on or not. This is used later in the code to loop through a while loop until the player moves the joystick in the correct direction.</p>
    <p>From there I used the random number created to turn one of the LEDs on at random. Then in the while loop I take in the values from the joystick and test to see if they correspond to 
        the correct state. In order to turn off the LED and move out of the while loop the position of the joystick and random LED must match up. 
    </p>
    <p>When all 20 iterations of the game are completed I take the end time and outputted the gamer's time and a message that says the game is over. The code below is also commented to make it easier to read.</p>

    <h2 id="Assignment3">Lab 3: "I came, I saw, I soldered"</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this lab I learned how to solder both stranded and solid-core wires to a Protoboard. </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Protoboard</li>
        <li>Stranded Wire</li>
        <li>Solid-core Wire</li>
        <li>Soldering Iron</li>
        <li>Lead-free, rosin core Solder Wire</li>
        <li>Fume Extractor</li>
        <li>Brass Wire Pad</li>
        <li>Soldering Helping Hands</li>
        <li>Solder Sucker Desoldering Pump</li>
        <li>Solder Wick</li>
        <li>Wire Stripper with Wire Cutter</li>
        <li>Safety Glasses (Regular glasses in my case)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Soldering Setup and Safety</h4>
    <p>Since I was unable to do the lab in the BTU lab, I created my own soldering station at home. 
        First I laid down a mat so no solder would get on the table. Next I set up the fume extractor to suck up any fumes 
        that come from the soldering iron. The soldering iron was then set up with the brass pad for cleaning the tip of 
        the soldering iron.
    </p>
    <p>
        When working with a soldering iron it is really important to use proper safety. I always wash my hands both 
        before and after working since residue will get on your hands. I wore my glasses to protect my eyes from any splatter 
        that might occur. I also wore a mask while working with the iron so as to not inhale any toxic fumes and protect my face. 
        I made sure that the area was well lit and had lots of space for the lab. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/Workspace.JPG" alt="Soldering Workspace">

    <h4>Part 2: Soldering Wires to Protoboard</h4>
    <p>To begin I started with tinning and cleaning the tip of my iron. I used a small amount of solder and the brass pad to clean the tip of the iron. </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/CleanedTip.JPG" alt="Tinned and Cleaned Tip">
    <p>Now I began to solder the wires to the board. First I had to cut the red, stranded wire to be four inches. I stripped about 2 millimeters 
        off of each end of the wire. I started in the corner of the board with one end and then went four spaces over to attach the other end of the wire. 
        Next I did the same for two, four inch white, solid-core wires in different rows. Below is a picture of all three wires connected. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/WiresBottom.JPG" alt="Wires Soldered to Protoboard">
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/WiresTop.JPG" alt="Wires Soldered to Protoboard">
    <p>I found that soldering the stranded wire to the Protoboard was much easier than the solid-core. The stranded wire has more surface 
        area that would attach to the Protoboard. The solid-core wire did not like to hold in the solder as well which made it hard to get a good joint. 
    </p>

    <h4>Part 3: Bridge of Solder</h4>
    <p>For this part of the lab I created three different traces that connected the wires together. This takes two different joints and connects them together 
        on the Protoboard. Below is a picture of the traces that I created.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/Traces.JPG" alt="Protoboard Traces">

    <h4>Part 4: Splicing Wires</h4>
    <p>In this part of the lab I practiced splicing wires together. First I cut the stranded wire into four, two inch pieces. Then I used the wire stripper to 
        strip about 2 millimeters off of each end of the wires. Next, I used the helping hands and put two wires in an alligator clip. I put a little bit of solder 
        on one side of each of the wires. Then I positioned them so that the sides with the solder were touching. When I placed the soldering iron on the joint the 
        solder from each wire melted together. I repeated this process for attaching the other two wires. Below is a picture of the joints and the final wire.

    <h2 id="Assignment2">Lab 2: React-I/O-n</h2>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This week's lab builds upon the simple circuitry from last week. I used the Arduino IDE to program the LED and button. For the final part of this lab 
        I built a game that times how fast it takes to hit the button. 
    </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arduino Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
            <li>USB Cable to connect the Board to my laptop</li>
            <li>Button</li>
            <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
            <li>Breadboard Jumper Wires</li>
            <li>2 100 Ohm Resistors and 1 10k Ohm Resistor</li>
            <li>LED</li>
            <li>Multimeter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Setting Up The Arduino IDE</h4>
    <p>For part 1 I set up the Arduino IDE for this board. Since I already had Arduino installed I 
        just had to make sure that the correct board and port were selected. For more information visit
         the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino website</a> for details on how to install the IDE. 
    </p>
    <p>For this lab I was using an Arduino Uno board plugged into the Comm Port 3. I used the UART to USB cable to 
        connect the board to my laptop. The connection went to Port 3. It's important to select both the correct Port and board
         under "Tools", if you don't then the code will not upload properly.
    </p>
    <p>To test if the board was connected properly I uploaded the Blink code from the example library. Since I set it up right, the 
         Arduino LED blinked every second as seen below.
    </p>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="BlinkingArduinoBoard">
        <source src=".\img\objectlab\Lab2\Lab2_BlinkVideo_Part1.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 2: Blinking an External LED</h4>
    <p>For the second part of this Lab I blinked an external LED on the 830 Tie-Points Breadboard. To do this I used the <strong>digitalWrite()</strong> 
        function in the Arduino IDE. When the LED is set to <strong>“LOW”</strong> that means that it is not getting any voltage and when it is set to <strong>“HIGH”</strong> 
        it is getting voltage. 
    </p>
    <p>In the <Strong>loop()</Strong> portion of the script I added a <strong>digitalWrite()</strong> function to set the LED pin to HIGH so that it turns on the LED. 
        Then I wrote a <strong>delay()</strong> statement that delayed the loop function by 1000 milliseconds or 1 second. Next, I called <strong>digitalWrite()</strong> again to set 
        the LED pin to <strong>LOW</strong> which turns off the LED. After that I used <strong>delay()</strong> again to delay the loop for another 1000 milliseconds. This makes the 
        LED turn on for a second then turn off for a second. 
    </p>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="BlinkingExternalLED">
        <source src="img\objectlab\Lab2\Blink2.MOV">
    </video>
    <p>
        It is fun to change around some of the parameters to see what happens. Below I changed the <strong>delay()</strong> function to blink on for three seconds then off for three seconds. 
        I also did one where the LED blinks every 100 milliseconds.

        <source src="img/objectlab/Lab2/SlowBlink3.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 3: Button Press and Serial Monitor</h4>
    <p>Next I wanted to add a button to the circuit that will change what the LED does. 
        First I added a pin that takes an input, which is the button. We can use the <strong>digitalRead()</strong> function to see what the input pin is set to. If it is HIGH that means the pin has power 
        and if it is LOW then the pin does not have voltage.
    </p>
    <p>The circuit I created is a pull-down resistor circuit where there is a 10 kilo-ohm resistor connected to the ground pin which helps regulate the voltage and current coming from the 5V 
        pin to the input pin. Below is a picture of the circuit along with a Fritzing schematic (wire colors match) which might be easier to follow. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab2/Circuit4.jpg" alt="Pull-down Resistor Circuit" >
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab2/FritzingCircuit.jpg" alt="Fritzing Circuit Diagram">
    <p>Next I worked with the serial monitor to test that the pin was reading the button input. Using the function <strong>Serial.println()</strong> you can print to the serial monitor. 
        To get familiar with the serial monitor I created the sketch below to print “Arduino Uno says Hello”. To set up the sketch I set the baud rate to 9600 using <strong>Serial.begin()</strong> in the 
        <strong>setup()</strong> function. Then in the <strong>loop()</strong> section I used <strong>Serial.println(“Arduino Uno says Hello!”)</strong> to print to the serial monitor.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab2/HelloPrint.jpg" alt="Hello World Code" width="800">
    <p>Now it is time to combine these concepts to create a program that prints to the serial monitor when the button is pressed and says “waiting” when the button is not pressed. Below is the code used for this process:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/fb9dde20e896fd55f5f65d0db1fe0463.js"></script>
    <p>First I initialized the pin that the button is connected to. I also initialized a boolean variable that will later store if the “waiting” message was sent. Then, in the <strong>setup()</strong> function I declared the 
        button as an input pin. It is also important to set the baud rate for the serial monitor using <strong>Serial.begin()</strong>. Now in the <strong>loop()</strong> function I need to create an if-statement to check if 
        the button is pressed or not. The first one checks if the button is not being pressed and the “waiting” message has not been sent then we need to print “waiting” to the serial monitor and change the boolean to true 
        since the message has now been sent. The next if-statement checks if the button is pressed. If it is then we print “success” to the serial monitor and reset the boolean variable to false since we now want it to send 
        the “waiting” message next time the button is not pressed. Below is the video of this working. (Please note that I had a 4 second delay in my loop so that is why the serial monitor is printing slower since it is not looping as fast)
    </p>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="SerialMonitor">
        <source src="img/objectlab/Lab2/ButtonPressed5.MOV">
    </video>
    <p>Since I added the delay the oscillation in the button was not apparent.</p>
    


    <h4>Part 4: LED Reaction Game</h4>
    <p>For Part 4 I created a reaction game that times the player between when the LED turns on and when they press the button. Below is the code that I used to create this:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/baeb17769ee0ae4504c58d093fe544b2.js"></script>
    <p>I start by initializing the LED pin and the button (input) pin. Now in the <strong>setup()</strong> function I declare the LED pin to be an output pin and the button pin 
        to be an input pin. Next I set the baud rate to 9600 to set up the serial monitor. I put the welcome message in the set up because I only wanted it to print once while 
        the player is playing the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <strong>loop()</strong> function I first have the message “ready” to prepare the user that the game has started. Next I use the <strong>random(min, max)</strong> function 
        to create a random number between 500 and 5000 that is stored in the integer <strong>randNumber</strong>. Then I delay by the number of milliseconds that randNumber holds. Then the 
        LED turns on after that random amount of time. When the LED turns on the time is taken using the <strong>millis()</strong> function and stored to a time variable. Next we go into a 
        “stalling” while loop that will run as long as the button is not pressed. Since we do not want anything to happen except time pass while we wait for the player to hit the button, 
        the while loop is empty. As soon as the button is pressed the <strong>INPUT_PIN</strong> has a value of <strong>HIGH </strong>and breaks the while loop and meets the conditions 
        for the if-statement. The time is taken again the moment the button is pressed. The LED is then turned off, resetting it for the next round. Then I print out the time in milliseconds 
        that it took for the player to hit the button. Outside of the if-statement the game/loop is reset in the serial monitor by printing “Game Restarting” and giving the player 5 seconds 
        to get ready. It will then loop back to the loop where it prints out “ready”. Below is a video of me playing the game!

    <h2 id="Assignment1">Lab 1: Simple Circuits</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For this lab I explored the concepts of electrical components in series and in parallel. 
        This was also an introductory lab to using a breadboard to connect electrical components. 
        I created a circuit that used resistors, and LED and button to light up the LEDs. </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <p>For this lab I used the following materials from my Arduino Uno Starter Kit: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Power Supply Module</li>
        <li>Button</li>
        <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
        <li>Breadboard Jumper Wires</li>
        <li>9V Battery with Snap-on Connector Clip</li>
        <li>100 ohm Resistors</li>
        <li>LED</li>
        <li>Multimeter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step in this lab was to set up power to the breadboard. I attached the power supply module to the breadboard so that
            one column of the board would be 5 volts and the other side would be 3.3 volts. Below are pictures of the multimeter reading out 5 
            volts and on the other side 3.3 volts: <br>
            <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/3_3VoltReading.jpg" alt="3.3 Volt Reading" >
            <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/5VoltReading.jpg" alt="5 Volt Reading">
        </li> <br>

        <li>Next I created a simple circuit that consisted of a 9 volt battery, a 100 ohm resistor, a blue LED and wires to connect them.
             For this circuit I used the 3.3V side of the breadboard. <br>
             <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/SimpleSchematic.jpg" alt="3.3 Volt Simple Circuit Schematic">
             <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/simpleCircuit_3V.jpg" alt="3.3 Volt Simple Circuit">
             <!-- Insert image of simple circuit and schematic -->
        </li><br>

        <li>Next I created the same simple circuit but used the 5 volt source. Since the voltage was higher I needed to use a different 
            resistor to make sure the current was within range. I found that the resistor needs to be at least 167 ohms so I just used 
            two 100 ohm resistors in series with each other. <br>
            <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/5Schematic.jpg" alt="5 Volt Simple Circuit Schematic">
            <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/simpleCircuit_5V.jpg" alt="5 Volt Simple Circuit">
            <!-- Insert image from the 5 volt side with equations --> 
        </li><br>

        <li>
            After this I incorporated a momentary switch into the circuit in series with the LED and resistor. When adding the button the 
            LED will only turn on when the button is pressed. This is because the button creates a break in the circuit when not pressed, 
            this does not allow current to flow. When the button is pressed the circuit is connected and current can flow freely. <br>
            <img class="labimg" src="/img/objectlab/SeriesButton.jpg" alt="Button in Series Schematic">
            <video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="Series LED">
                <source src="/img/objectlab/SeriesButton.mov">
            </video>
        </li><br>

        <li>For the extra credit assignment we had to get the button to work in reverse: the light turned off when the button was pressed. 
            To do this I made the button and LED in parallel with each other. The 100 ohm resistor is in series with each loop in the parallel 
            circuit so that no matter which direction current flows it has to go through the resistor. The reason that the button works opposite 
            from when it was in series is because of the way current flows through parallel circuits. The LED can be thought of as a very small 
            resistor in a circuit. The button, when pressed, can be thought of as a wire with negligible resistance. When current gets to the junction 
            where it either goes to the LED (acting like a resistor) or through the button (acting like a wire) it chooses the “path of least resistance” 
            and the current goes through the button instead of the branch with the LED. When the button is not pressed then that loop is a broken circuit 
            and no current can flow through that branch causing all of it to go to the LED. <br>
