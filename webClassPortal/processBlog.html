    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 1</h3>
    <h4>September 6, 2023 </h4>

    <p>
        I am going to host my Class Portal on my portfolio website. I started this website about a year ago and my goal is to have it be 
        something I can showcase that shows both my web development abilities and the other technical projects that I have worked on. 
        As shown on the first page of the wireframe below, this portal is going to be located under “Class Blogs” since I have several 
        classes that need a blog-like portfolio. Within the class portal I plan to have four different pages, Main, Projects, Assignments 
        and Process Blog. Each of these pages can be seen on pages 2-9 wireframe. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On each wireframe page I created boxes that outline the general location of the information. I do not plan to have each item in a 
        box with borders but the boxes help me visualize the space on the page which content will be confined to. I am also going to have to 
        learn about how to create the drop-down menu style since that is not currently implemented in this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main page of the Class Portal will have three buttons at the top of it that link out to the other pages where the assignments, 
        projects and blog posts are going to be turned in. This page is also intended to give context to a potential employer or someone 
        without knowledge of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        My portfolio has an overall minimalist appearance to it that I plan to keep. I want to keep readers focused on the content without 
        a lot of distractions on the page. Something that I want to improve as far as layout is image sizing. I always feel that my images 
        are either too big and break up the text too much or are too small to see all of the details.

    <!-- Entry 2: Class Portal Milestone 2 -->
    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 2</h3>
    <h4>September 19, 2023 </h4>

    <p>
        I started this Class Portal with a solid foundation from my portfolio website. I started by creating a new page that represents the 
        home page for the class portal and linking that to the navigation bar at the top of the website. From that home page I created more 
        pages that link out to the three different pages for the Class Portal: Projects, Assignments and Process Blog.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I wanted to create a drop down menu for the separate pages on the navigation bar. Unfortunately I ran into a lot of issues with that. 
        I am continuing to troubleshoot that as I still plan to implement the drop down. I think that I was defining the navigation bar incorrectly. 
        Since I was really sick all last week I did not have as much time as I needed to debug this to get it working. Therefore, it will be a late 
        implementation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to continue to play around with the Home Page for this portal. Once I get some assignments and projects I want to make the buttons 
        images that represent the types of projects on that page. This concept can kind of be seen on the wireframe from Milestone 1. In the meantime I 
        played around with some of the <em>flex</em> properties we learned about in class. I have previously only used grid so I am going to be changing everything 
        over to flex.

        <!-- Entry 3: Project Milestone 1 -->
        <h3>Project 1 - Milestone 1: Proposal</h3>
        <h4>October 12, 2023 </h4>

        <h5>Project Overview:</h5>
        <p>
            For Project 1 I would like to create a website to help my job with presenting data sets. Right now we are using screenshots from code environments to display data. 
            I would like to use the D3.js library to figure out how to represent that data in an interactive way. The audience for this project are engineers on my project 
            that have to handle data taken through testing.
        </p>

        <h5>Use of Javascript:</h5>
        <p>
            This project is going to heavily rely on JavaScript as all of the data visualizations will be done through JavaScript. By using JavaScript it will make the 
            graphs and 3D data models interactive instead of stationary images. I would also like to use Javascript to enhance the aesthetics of the website. I want to 
            include hover options and other event listeners to give users input as they go throughout the website. 
        </p>

        <h5>Use of Javascript Library:</h5>
        <p>
            After doing some research I would like to use D3.js to represent the data. They have features for interactive data sets, 3D graphing, geo-mapping and more. 
            I think that it would be really cool to use the interactive visualizations to explore the different tests that we do. I also really want to create a 3D map 
            that shows all of our global teams (we have 220 teams from 30 different countries) and it would be so amazing to have a visualization of those teams that isn't 
            just a google map with markers that would really help our marketing.
        </p>

        <h5>Resources:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Various spreadsheets internal to work that has all our testing data
                <ul>
                    <li>Antenna signal strength</li>
                    <li>Micrometeorite impact testing</li>
                    <li>Housing and Deployment Prototype distance testing</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Locations of global teams which are found in our participant information spreadsheet</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Responsive Design:</h5>
        <p>
            To make this responsive I would like to use media queries that will change the layout of the page for different sized screens. I will also explore the extent 
            of D3.js to see what features they have to make their visualizations work on different devices. 
        </p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <h5>Prototyping/proof of concept:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to have the base of the website built by October 19</li>
            <li>I want to have all of my data in the correct format for the libraries by October 19</li>
            <li>Talk to my team about the best way to represent all of the data</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Minimal Viable Product</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to have at least static 2D and 3D models</li>
            <li>I want to have an interactive map of all of the teams from across the world</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Stretch Goals</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Create something that can take in data through the website</li>
            <li>Explore different aesthetic minimalist design using my project's branding guide</li>
            <li>Making all of the data interactive in some aspect</li>
        </ul>
