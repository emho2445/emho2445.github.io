    <h2>Project 1 - Wood Polygon</h2>
    <h3>September 24, 2023</h3>

    <p>
        The first step in creating this project was to sketch out my ideas. I wanted to create a polygon with an open side so that it would be able to hold items. 
        I also wanted to get a chance to work with different types of joining so I wanted to join edges and also vertices. This is why I chose the 8 sided polygon 
        with half being solid walls and the other half created by open faces. I did the necessary calculations to figure out how much space I needed and how to 
        arrange the pieces I needed to cut out. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Next I created a mockup out of cardboard. This allowed me to make sure that my measurements were correct and that the pieces would fit on the amount of wood we were given.
    </p>

    <p>
        I next had to choose which type of wood I wanted to make this out of. I chose the poplar wood because I liked the slight green hue of the wood. 
        The first thing I did once I got the wood was split the wood in half so that I had twice as much area to work with and my pieces could be thinner. 
        To do this I used the table saw to cut slits on both sides and then used the band saw to finish splitting the wood. This left a seam/stripe on 
        some of the wood since the band saw has a much thinner blade than the table saw. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I then used the band saw to cut out the triangles and the edges for the bottom of the object. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To create the miter edges I used the sander. I originally wanted to use the chop saw but the pieces were too small and the angles too large so it was 
        not safe to use it. Instead I just used the belt sander to sand down the edges. However, it is much harder to be precise with that method so some of the 
        edges on the solid-walled side don't really match up perfectly. I think if I were to do this again I would use either the band saw or measure the sides 
        of the wood so I knew how far down to sand.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create the support edges for the bottom of the piece I used the band saw to cut the angles and then the sander to make them smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next I started to glue the pieces together. I started by gluing the 3 solid triangle sides together. I attached the open edges to the square middle. 
        After those two pieces dried I attached them together. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Next I sanded down the edges so that they are smooth and in some cases, I sanded them down to fit together. Part of this process also involved using wood 
        putty to fill in some of the major gaps that were between the square middle piece and the wood triangles. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The final step I took was to use oil to finish the project. I used the clear finishing oil liberally with a rag to apply it to all surfaces and edges of the polygon. 
    </p>

        When the piece was dry I went over to the documentation station and took some final photos of the wood.

    <h2>Draw a Tree</h2>
    <h3>September 19, 2023</h3>
    <p>
        The baldcypress is usually found in wet, swamp-like environments however we have one on our campus here in Boulder, Colorado. From 
        some quick background research it appears that the baldcypress is usually a large tree with firm limbs. If I had to guess the one I 
        sketched, the one on campus, is a little droopy and short because it is not in its natural habitat. I noticed that parts of the tree were 
        filled in and other parts were more sparse. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When taking a closer look at the bark it had a very thin vertical pattern. It was also very peely meaning that the edges of the bark pieces 
        started to peel up. The outside bark was a greyish brown with a redish orange bark under the peeling bark. The branches were more "bare" as far 
        as bark. They had more of the orange wood underneath showing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The needles of this tree are very different than other conifer trees. The baldcypress needles are very soft and feel like leaves. These extremely short, 
        soft needles made the tree look very fuzzy. The needles grew in long groups together almost as if they are a leaf in a sense. These long needle 
        groups also gave the tree a droopy appearance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The images below are of the full tree, bark pattern and leaf pattern.

    <h2>Favorite Object</h2>
    <p>My favorite object is one that I've had since before I can remember. Her name is Kitty Kitty. She is a small, tan, stuffed
        cat wearing a neutral beige onesie. She is made out of a fuzzy, fur-like cloth with textured cloth clothes.
        Ever since I was little I remember playing with her outfit as the back of the onesie opens and you can take the tail in and out.
        She is special to me because she was always the toy I would go to when I was extremely happy or upset. She's traveled the world
        with me on vacations and is the only toy/stuffed animal I've brought to college. Whenever I need some comfort she is there for me.
