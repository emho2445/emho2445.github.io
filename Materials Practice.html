    <h2>Draw a Tree</h2>
    <h3>September 19, 2023</h3>
    <p>
        The baldcypress is usually found in wet, swamp-like environments however we have one on our campus here in Boulder, Colorado. From 
        some quick background research it appears that the baldcypress is usually a large tree with firm limbs. If I had to guess the one I 
        sketched, the one on campus, is a little droopy and short because it is not in its natural habitat. I noticed that parts of the tree were 
        filled in and other parts were more sparse. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When taking a closer look at the bark it had a very thin vertical pattern. It was also very peely meaning that the edges of the bark pieces 
        started to peel up. The outside bark was a greyish brown with a redish orange bark under the peeling bark. The branches were more "bare" as far 
        as bark. They had more of the orange wood underneath showing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The needles of this tree are very different than other conifer trees. The baldcypress needles are very soft and feel like leaves. These extremely short, 
        soft needles made the tree look very fuzzy. The needles grew in long groups together almost as if they are a leaf in a sense. These long needle 
        groups also gave the tree a droopy appearance.

        The images below are of the full tree, bark pattern and leaf pattern.

    <h2>Favorite Object</h2>
    <p>My favorite object is one that I've had since before I can remember. Her name is Kitty Kitty. She is a small, tan, stuffed
        cat wearing a neutral beige onesie. She is made out of a fuzzy, fur-like cloth with textured cloth clothes.
        Ever since I was little I remember playing with her outfit as the back of the onesie opens and you can take the tail in and out.
        She is special to me because she was always the toy I would go to when I was extremely happy or upset. She's traveled the world
        with me on vacations and is the only toy/stuffed animal I've brought to college. Whenever I need some comfort she is there for me.
