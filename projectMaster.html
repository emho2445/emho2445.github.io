    <p>
        Project Master is a website geared towards engineering students in project management positions. 
        The website will help them organize their management documents as well as educate and guide them 
        throughout the project management process.

            This project was developed from the start to be a kick-start to a project that had the 
            opportunity to move beyond the school year. The goal was to create a minimal viable 
            product (MVP) that could be pitched to full website development companies for investment 
            and development. The MVP needed to showcase the quality of content that would be hosted 
            as well as the basics of user experience. The scope of this project was to achieve the 
            MVP that can later be pitched for full development. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This project consisted of two main parts, the first being the project management assets 
            and the second being the front-end developed website. The project management assets 
            include the educational tutorials that are designed to be bite-sized attainable lessons 
            to help students learn important project management concepts. Each tutorial is roughly 
            10 minutes of content and then pairs with a template, the other part of the project 
            management assets. Each template guides students through creating important 
            organizational documents for their project. The topics of the tutorials and templates 
            are based off of the content in the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. 
            The PMP certification is widely known as the leading professional certification in project 
            management.

            During the course of this project I was able to build my knowledge within both project 
            management and software development. For this project I took the lead on the software 
            and worked with React JS. Something important to note is that Project Master was 
            developed using React JS which is significantly different from web development through 
            plain JavaScript and HTML. I was able to create the page router for the website that 
            navigates between the different pages, the tutorial and template pages as well as the 
            login/signup page. Throughout the coding process I also determined the design of the 
            website as it varied from the original wireframe that was created with Figma.
