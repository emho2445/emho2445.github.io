    <h2>Leadership Portfolio</h2>

    <p>Throughout my postsecondary and undergraduate education leadership development has been an 
        integral part of my coursework and extracurricular activities. This portfolio outlines my 
        traditional leadership coursework during my undergraduate education at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        During my undergraduate coursework I completed leadership courses in multiple departments 
        all culminating in completing my Leadership Studies Minor. Below is a description of each 
        course I took for the LSM. 
    </p>

    <h3>EHON 1151: Critical Encounters: Engineering Honors</h3>
    <p>Explores critical, literary and philosophical approaches to the following related problems: 
        1: how we organize knowledge and construct meaning, and 2: how we locate a sense of self as 
        both individuals and members of various groups amidst the resources and demands of competing 
        interpretations, traditions, challenges and circumstances. 
    </p>

    <h3>ENLP 3100: Complex Leadership Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Approaches leadership as a process of inquiry, empathy, and action, cultivating skills leaders 
        need to understand, communicate about, and generate innovative approaches to complex issues. 
        Each student conducts extensive, principled research about a complex social issue of their choice, 
        investigating its multidimensionality by applying different analytic lenses.
    </p>

    <h3>ENLP 3000: Intelligent Leadership</h3>
    <p>
        Investigates what it means to be a "smart" leader. In small, discussion-based classes, explores 
        science fiction texts and social science research that generate fundamental questions about the 
        dimensions, manifestations and value of intelligence in contexts related to leadership. Students 
        explore social science research about how course themes are reflected in present-day, "real-life" 
        technologies, policies and cultural phenomena. 
    </p>

    <h3>ENLP 4000: The Empire of Modern Science</h3>
    <p>
        Examines science and technology's rise to the status of political, cultural and economic leader of 
        the modern world. Also considers the ambitions and limits of the modern scientific enterprise, and 
        investigates whether scientists are adequately equipped to lead humanity's political, spiritual and 
        evolutionary future. Readings are drawn from primary sources in history, economics, politics, 
        philosophy and literature.
    </p>

    <h3>LEAD 4000: Leadership Capstone</h3>
    <p>
        Integrates leadership topics and experiences students pursued through the Leadership Studies Minor. 
        Using advanced critical thinking skills, the seminar requires students to evidence their knowledge, 
        competencies and skills related to leadership theory and practice through examining contemporary 
        leadership challenges. Further, the seminar directs students to justify decision-making processes, 
        demonstrating their ability to synthesize prior knowledge to effect desirable, ethical outcomes.

    <h3>AHA Leadership Moments</h3>

    <h4>#1 Mentoring High School Students</h4>
    <p>
        During my first two years of college I was the Colorado State Officer Team Advisor for Colorado 
        Technology Student Association where I oversaw a leadership program for high school students that 
        I had been a part of during high school. While in this role I had to establish a leadership curriculum 
        and teach them how to be effective organizational leaders. The biggest take away that I wanted for them 
        was to understand that being a leader is not about having a fancy title, it's about the actions that 
        you take that make you a leader. Four years later I attended a conference where one of these students 
        gave a keynote speech and during that he referenced the training that I did and how a great mentor 
        once told him “Leadership is an action, not a position”. Hearing that I was able to make an impact 
        on this student and the team and they remembered my key takeaway was a very magical moment. 
    </p>

    <h4>#2 Transitioning to a new team</h4>
    <p>
        A few years into my job I had the honor of being selected for Project Manager which meant turning 
        over the current subteam that I was leading over to someone else. I had been the Global STEM 
        Engagement lead for over 2 years and had put a lot of work into the team. I was really nervous 
        about handing over all that work to someone else and started to still micromanage that subteam. 
        After a while I realized that I was bogged down and overwhelmed with everything that I had promised 
        my team that I would do and I was doing random tasks from my old position. This is when I realized 
        that this is why we have team members and that I had to trust my team. I was the one hindering 
        progress because I should have been trusting them and taking a step back to let them lead. 
        I now hold a very strong opinion that being a great leader also means knowing when to take a step 
        back and let others lead. 
    </p>

    <h4>#3 Challenge the process</h4>
    <p>
        As an engineering student I am used to following formulas and procedures that I've been taught 
        without questioning. We are taught that there is a specific way to do everything and to solve 
        problems. Which works great in certain situations within engineering but not when interacting 
        with people and complex issues. Doing things the way they've always been done breeds complacency 
        for ineffective methods. When I moved up into project management on my team there were a lot of 
        systems that didn't make a ton of sense to me but the previous manager told me that's just what 
        she was told to do and it's just how things work. Very quickly after starting I began talking 
        with my supervisor about how to create some better processes that would adapt to what the team 
        needed moving forward. At first people seemed reluctant to change our entire documentation 
        system but after a semester everyone was super grateful that we had a process that worked best 
        for the team. I learned that change will often be met with resistance but that challenging the 
        process is critical for growth. 
    </p>

    <h4>#4 Be there</h4>
    <p>
        When I was in charge of the Global STEM Engagement team at work I had some challenging moments. 
        There was a particular point where I had been having some personal conflicts outside of work that 
        was affecting my ability to be present during class and work. After a few weeks of this changed 
        behavior my supervisor called me in to discuss what was going on. While meeting she mentioned 
        that as a leader I needed to make sure that I was showing up for my team and being present with 
        them. In this moment it resonated with me that the most important thing for a leader to do is to 
        show up. From there on out I have made it a priority to be sure to show up to everything and keep 
        those commitments. I show up to work and nonwork related things for my team members to just show 
        support and be there for them.
    </p>

    <h4>#5 Creating connections</h4>
    <p>
        Over the last several years I've had the pleasure of working with lots of different students 
        through my position at NASA Colorado Space Grant Consortium. Each semester the teams would change 
        up and new team dynamics would emerge. Recently as the lead of the entire project I started to 
        see how my actions and emotions would affect the entire team and how they interacted with each 
        other. This is when I started to create a lot of intentional positive activities for us to do as 
        a team and started to reach out to members to create deeper personal connections as well. I 
        noticed that once we started bonding as a team that performance and attendance increased at work. 
        The workplace atmosphere became more lively and overall it was a better place to work. As a leader 
        we can take intentional steps to create healthy spaces and deepen connections.

    <h3>Leadership Philosophy</h3>
    <h4>(So What and Now What Essays)</h4>

    <p>
        Throughout high school I focused a lot on my leadership development. Not only for college admissions 
        but also because it was what brought me joy. It gave me a sense of purpose and made me feel closer 
        to my peers. I joined an organization called the Technology Student Association (TSA) at the beginning 
        of my seventh grade year. When I got to high school I felt prepared to run for state office. Being 
        elected to State Treasurer led me to so many influential experiences. 
    </p>

    <p>
        One of them being one of my most impactful leadership moments. The very first meeting we had I was 
        put in charge of the Special Projects Committee, which would be in charge of fundraising, community 
        service, statewide social events and events at the state conference. It was a huge undertaking and 
        I learned so much from being the head of all of that. As an officer I also had lots of 
        responsibilities that involved public speaking. My first major presentation was at the Colorado 
        Association for Career and Technical Education (CACTE) where I presented to STEM teachers from 
        across the state. This experience lit a fire under me and made me realize how passionate I was for 
        my organization and for its mission. From that moment on I emphasized the importance of authenticity 
        and passion when it comes to leadership. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Another crucible experience came from being in TSA. I wanted to grow in the organization by going 
        to the national level. I put in blood, sweat and tears into my campaign. I wrote speeches, made 
        campaign materials and presentations. I put everything into my speech as I spoke to a group of 
        peers larger than 8,000. It challenged every skill that I had been developing. I was crushed when 
        I got beat out by my opponent. It taught me to be humble about my skill set. It put a lot of things 
        in perspective and reinforced that nothing is ever handed to you and that competition is motivating. 
        From there I already started thinking about how I could improve for next year. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It was a stroke of luck on my part that just a few weeks later I was offered the position. The 
        other candidate had been removed already and they wanted me to step up and take the position. 
        Being a National Officer was one of the best experiences of my life. It taught me communication, 
        event programming, and what it means to be a brand ambassador. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My whole experience with the Technology Student Association was enough to set the groundwork for 
        my college career. I took a job with them immediately after graduating and became the State Officer 
        Team Advisor. This was a whole new set of skills needed. I had always had an advisor and now I had 
        to learn to be the advisor. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been able to apply a lot of these skills to my job as a Team Lead and then Project Manager for 
        the Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone. It was hard to adjust to being in charge of an entire 
        subteam to being in charge of an entire program. I've made lots of mistakes and had to grow a lot 
        as a leader. I had to take a step back several times to re-evaluate how I was as a leader. I would 
        meet with staff to talk about what I can be doing better. Managing a group of busy college students 
        has proven challenging and I am still learning how to be the best lead that I can. One of the most 
        awkward conversations I had was apologizing to my team for not being the best version of myself. 
        I vowed to be more communicative and supportive of their tasks. I've learned how to be dependable 
        and how that is one of the most important aspects of leadership. It was hard on the team since they 
        didn't know if I was always going to be there. Once I started showing up more it dramatically 
        changed the team dynamic. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The conversation of “why leadership” is one that I've had with my parents a lot. I always sign up 
        for leadership opportunities when they come up. When I signed up to be on my executive board for 
        my sorority my parents were super confused why I would add more to my plate. Selfishly, leadership 
        gives me a sense of purpose. It allows me to come out of my shell and feel comfortable talking. 
        Internally I feel like a different person, but more of myself. I think that a lot of my personality 
        comes out when I lead. I also love the adrenaline rush that comes with being a leader. I think 
        I've become used to living in a constant state of stress, not all of which is good. However, 
        the stress that a leader faces excites me. I find that it's the type of stress that causes me to 
        be productive and a better version of myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of all, I love leadership because I love enabling others to succeed. As long as I can remember 
        I've always loved helping people. Leadership is a great way to help a lot of people. It is 
        rewarding to see others flourish and know that I was able to help them. Being able to encourage 
        others and see their happiness makes me happy! As a leader I want to help keep those around me on 
        track. A leader needs to be on top of goals and deadlines and help keep others motivated. I also 
        love supporting people to be their best selves.
    </p>

    <p>
        I developed a strong sense of values when I started getting involved in leadership. Being a leader 
        made me realize that you need to “stand for something” and your actions need to follow. Through 
        my experiences I've found that my core values are honesty, passion and authenticity. When I get 
        on a team I emphasize the importance of being fully authentic and doing things that align with you 
        as a person. Looking into work culture values are super important since it's hard to work for a 
        company if they don't value the same things. By picking jobs and projects that align with my values 
        I'm able to be proud of the work that I do. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My leadership training was based on the Student Leadership Challenge which uses five pillars: 
        Challenge the Process, Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage 
        the Heart. This has shaped the way that I lead. If you are on my team you can expect me to start 
        by modeling the behavior that I expect. I believe that leaders are not above those who they are 
        leading. If you want your team to do something, you need to be willing to do it as well. I don't 
        think that the standards should be any different for the person in charge. You can see this with 
        how our exec team decided that we would need to qualify for formal as well. In the past the exec 
        team got to go to formal no matter what but we decided that wasn't fair to everyone else. 
    </p>

    <p>
        They can expect me to challenge their way of thinking. The worst thing EVER is saying “because 
        it's the way it's always been done” for the main reason for doing something. Leaders need to 
        innovate and try new things. We need to advance and the only way to do that is to challenge the 
        way that things have always been done. I like to lead with innovation and allow a space for 
        everyone to give ideas. A really important exercise that I taught the students I advised was 
        saying “yes, and” instead of “but”. A team needs to be a safe place for people to speak and create. 
        I believe in creating a safe space for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        When it comes to inspiring a shared vision I need to make sure that everyone is on the same page. 
        This comes with a lot of communication. I have weekly meetings and I also try to tag-up with my 
        co-workers daily so that there isn't any confusion. Open and constant communication are necessary 
        for teams to be productive. This also means that I need to be approachable. Effective communication 
        relies on good work relationships. Another key aspect to getting everyone on the same page is 
        making sure that everyone's ideas are a part of the vision. The end goal can't be one person's, 
        it has to reflect the team as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        This then ties into enabling others to act. I always try to delegate to an individual's strengths. 
        To me this also means allowing others to grow in skills if they wish. They should be allowed 
        personal development and to shine in areas that they are good at. This ties into encouraging the 
        heart. Praise and recognition go so far on a team. I always try to do public praise at our meetings 
        to let our advisors know how well people are doing on their tasks. If criticism needs to happen it 
        should be private and direct. The way that you praise and criticize can greatly affect the team 
        dynamic and how safe people feel at work so it needs to be done carefully. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I continue to learn how to be a better leader and I love being put in positions where growth is 
        necessary. Leadership really is a journey and not a destination. I can always keep learning and 
        improving. I try to be as level headed as possible and take criticism in order to learn. My 
        leadership will continue to grow as I take new positions after college and at my current job.
    </p>
