    <h1>The Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone Data Visualizations</h1>

    <p>
        The Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone (GLEE) is a NASA-funded technology demonstration aiming to 
        implement distributed data in planetary science by deploying a network of small solar-powered sensing PCBs, 
        called LunaSats, across the lunar surface. The datasets created by recording the time evolution of physical 
        variables at several locations simultaneously, producing a time-varying and space-varying dataset capable of 
        powerful scientific insight. As the expansion of the space industry takes place, so does the need for reliable, 
        cost-effective, data collection across planetary bodies such as the Moon.  
    </p>

    <h2>Accelerometer Sensor Testing</h2>
    <p>Micrometeorites can pose a serious issue to astronauts, electronics, and any kind of structure on the lunar surface. 
        On average, 33 tons = 73,000 lbs. of meteoritic material intersect the Earth's path every day. The moon is in the 
        same meteoroid environment as Earth and experiences similar conditions. These meteorites are burned up in our atmosphere, 
        but the moon does not possess this shield. The ability to detect, measure, and record micrometeorite impacts on the lunar 
        surface would provide valuable data to the Hyperdrive Science team, GLEE, NASA, and the Artemis missions.
    </p>

    <p>The goal of this test is to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Determine the sensitivity and the range of our accelerometer for micrometeorite impacts. 
        </li>
        <li>
            See how different environments/mediums affect the propagation of the impact. (Sand, dirt, clay) 
        </li>
        <li>
            To test accelerometer performance under various environmental conditions applicable to our mission.
        </li>
        <li>
            Understand the sampling rate of the accelerometer and see if it is sufficient.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Spacecraft LunaSat Deployment</h2>
    <p>
        HDP 1.1 is a prototype designed to house LunaSats and then deploy them on the lunar surface in a 
        manner that satisfies given requirements for dispersal. Some of these requirements include the 
        precise deployment of at least 75 LunaSats from an independently operating design that is built to 
        survive the lunar environment. HDP 1.1 maintains the disk launcher inspired design of HDP 1.0 with 
        the capacity to be a variable-speed feeding system which will allow us to achieve our desired deployment 
        pattern. 
    </p>

        Use the button below the graph to see the dispersion of the LunaSats with different motor power levels.
