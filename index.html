    <h2>Hello! My name is Emma Hopson and I go by she/her pronouns.</h2>
    <p>My goal for this course is to strengthen my coding skills. I've learned HTML and CSS in the past but it's been a long time. I want to re-learn those languages as well as learn new ones!</p>
    <p>I just switched to the Creative Technology and Design major and I'm excited to start this new journey. I'm still learning what I'm passionate about and I hope this class will help!</p>
