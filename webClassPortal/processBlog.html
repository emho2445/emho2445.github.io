    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 1</h3>
    <h4>September 6, 2023 </h4>

    <p>
        I am going to host my Class Portal on my portfolio website. I started this website about a year ago and my goal is to have it be 
        something I can showcase that shows both my web development abilities and the other technical projects that I have worked on. 
        As shown on the first page of the wireframe below, this portal is going to be located under “Class Blogs” since I have several 
        classes that need a blog-like portfolio. Within the class portal I plan to have four different pages, Main, Projects, Assignments 
        and Process Blog. Each of these pages can be seen on pages 2-9 wireframe. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On each wireframe page I created boxes that outline the general location of the information. I do not plan to have each item in a 
        box with borders but the boxes help me visualize the space on the page which content will be confined to. I am also going to have to 
        learn about how to create the drop-down menu style since that is not currently implemented in this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main page of the Class Portal will have three buttons at the top of it that link out to the other pages where the assignments, 
        projects and blog posts are going to be turned in. This page is also intended to give context to a potential employer or someone 
        without knowledge of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        My portfolio has an overall minimalist appearance to it that I plan to keep. I want to keep readers focused on the content without 
        a lot of distractions on the page. Something that I want to improve as far as layout is image sizing. I always feel that my images 
        are either too big and break up the text too much or are too small to see all of the details.

    <!-- Entry 2: Class Portal Milestone 2 -->
    <h3>Class Portal - Milestone 2</h3>
    <h4>September 19, 2023 </h4>

    <p>
        I started this Class Portal with a solid foundation from my portfolio website. I started by creating a new page that represents the 
        home page for the class portal and linking that to the navigation bar at the top of the website. From that home page I created more 
        pages that link out to the three different pages for the Class Portal: Projects, Assignments and Process Blog.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I wanted to create a drop down menu for the separate pages on the navigation bar. Unfortunately I ran into a lot of issues with that. 
        I am continuing to troubleshoot that as I still plan to implement the drop down. I think that I was defining the navigation bar incorrectly. 
        Since I was really sick all last week I did not have as much time as I needed to debug this to get it working. Therefore, it will be a late 
        implementation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to continue to play around with the Home Page for this portal. Once I get some assignments and projects I want to make the buttons 
        images that represent the types of projects on that page. This concept can kind of be seen on the wireframe from Milestone 1. In the meantime I 
        played around with some of the <em>flex</em> properties we learned about in class. I have previously only used grid so I am going to be changing everything 
        over to flex.

        <!-- Entry 3: Project Milestone 1 -->
        <h3>Project 1 - Milestone 1: Proposal</h3>
        <h4>October 12, 2023 </h4>

        <h5>Project Overview:</h5>
        <p>
            For Project 1 I would like to create a website to help my job with presenting data sets. Right now we are using screenshots from code environments to display data. 
            I would like to use the D3.js library to figure out how to represent that data in an interactive way. The audience for this project are engineers on my project 
            that have to handle data taken through testing.
        </p>

        <h5>Use of Javascript:</h5>
        <p>
            This project is going to heavily rely on JavaScript as all of the data visualizations will be done through JavaScript. By using JavaScript it will make the 
            graphs and 3D data models interactive instead of stationary images. I would also like to use Javascript to enhance the aesthetics of the website. I want to 
            include hover options and other event listeners to give users input as they go throughout the website. 
        </p>

        <h5>Use of Javascript Library:</h5>
        <p>
            After doing some research I would like to use D3.js to represent the data. They have features for interactive data sets, 3D graphing, geo-mapping and more. 
            I think that it would be really cool to use the interactive visualizations to explore the different tests that we do. I also really want to create a 3D map 
            that shows all of our global teams (we have 220 teams from 30 different countries) and it would be so amazing to have a visualization of those teams that isn't 
            just a google map with markers that would really help our marketing.
        </p>

        <h5>Resources:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Various spreadsheets internal to work that has all our testing data
                <ul>
                    <li>Antenna signal strength</li>
                    <li>Micrometeorite impact testing</li>
                    <li>Housing and Deployment Prototype distance testing</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Locations of global teams which are found in our participant information spreadsheet</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Responsive Design:</h5>
        <p>
            To make this responsive I would like to use media queries that will change the layout of the page for different sized screens. I will also explore the extent 
            of D3.js to see what features they have to make their visualizations work on different devices. 
        </p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <h5>Prototyping/proof of concept:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to have the base of the website built by October 19</li>
            <li>I want to have all of my data in the correct format for the libraries by October 19</li>
            <li>Talk to my team about the best way to represent all of the data</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Minimal Viable Product</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to have at least static 2D and 3D models</li>
            <li>I want to have an interactive map of all of the teams from across the world</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Stretch Goals</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Create something that can take in data through the website</li>
            <li>Explore different aesthetic minimalist design using my project's branding guide</li>
            <li>Making all of the data interactive in some aspect</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Entry 4: Project Milestone 1 Reflection-->
        <h3>Project 1 - Milestone 4: Reflection</h3>
        <h4>November 9, 2023 </h4>

        <p>
            For project one I definitely ran into more challenges than I thought I would. I started with a fairly 
            ambitious project of creating interactive 2D and 3D data as well as maps with information. I based this 
            off of the examples that I saw on the D3.js website. However when I started coding the project I ran into 
            issues with the data format and library capabilities. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My process was to start with the 2D data to get a grasp on the library and then move on to the harder 3D and 
            map visualizations. Once I got my graphs in place I started working on interactive JavaScript. Then I created 
            all of the information on the website that gives context to the website.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I started with the 2D graphs, first I created a basic empty graph with two axes and this was fairly simple. 
            I didn't run into any problems with creating the canvas for the graphs. Once I tried to start reading in my data 
            points is when I started running into issues. The data that I had was a CSV file with headers but I didn't realize 
            that all my data had to be objects with properties that were the data points. So I figured out a way to read in my 
            data and then turn it into objects. Once that data was in the correct format making the line graph was very simple. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When I went to start looking at the 3D data and the map I realized that D3.js does not support those features on its 
            own. All of the examples that I was looking at when I created my proposal had other imported libraries and data sets 
            that were beyond the scope of what I was going to be able to learn in the given time. This was a huge barrier to my project. 
            I decided that creating these data visualizations was not going to be possible. 
        </p>

        <p>
            By the end of this project I do feel much more confident using the D3.js library. I was able to figure out different types 
            of scales for the axes, plots and line graphs. I also learned how to read their documentation. I think that this is a library 
            that I would use again and I enjoyed working with it. In the future I might want to try some of the other libraries that people 
            were using alongside it to do some of the more complicated data visualizations. 
        </p>

    <!-- Entry 5: Project 2 Milestone 1 -->
    <h3>Project 2 - Milestone 1</h3>
    <h4>November 16, 2023 </h4>

    <h5>Group Members:</h5>
    <p>
        Kaya Walker, Emma Hopson, Sydney Calcagno
    </p>

    <h5>Overall Project Description:</h5>
    <p>
        Our single page application (SPA) is to be a fun trivia game that gives the player different trivia questions within different categories. 
        The inspiration for this SPA is the game Trivia Crack that became extremely popular around 2014. In Trivia Crack players would spin the 
        wheel to get the question category, if they got the question correct they would get to spin the wheel for a new question. The goal was to 
        get a character, which was a symbol of category mastery, before the other person. Our website will draw similar features from this game. 
        We intend to have different question categories and present the user with different types of trivia questions. Our website will be different 
        in key ways as ours is going to be single player and track overall success/progress instead of collecting icons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our audience will most likely be ages 16-35 as we intend to find an API that has cultural trivia meant for young adults and teens. 
    </p>

    <h5>Wireframe:</h5>
    <object data="./TriviaProject.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px"></object>

    <h5>Sources:</h5>
    <p>
        For this project we are going to use a trivia API to generate all of the questions. The API that we chose is Open Trivia Database. This API 
        is free and does not require an API key or account. This API also allows us to pull more than just the question and answer, it has other false 
        answer options, a difficulty level and a category. This will allow us to potentially track the “expert” level of the player as well. 
    </p>
    <p>Link to Open Trivia Database: <a href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php">https://opentdb.com/api_config.php</a></p>
    <p>
        Outside of this API we do not anticipate needing any additional information or resources.
    </p>

    <h5>Personal Contribution:</h5>
    <p>
        My contribution to this team will be helping read in the API, getting our GitHub set up and potentially helping with the progress tracker for 
        our stretch goals. I think that we are all on the same page that we are happy to help with anything that needs to be done. I have also talked 
        to both of my team members about being gone from December 10-13 so I will do my best to have all of my parts done before I leave. 
    </p>

    <h5>Goals:</h5>
    <p>Prototyping/Proof of Concept:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reading in the API
        </li>

    <!-- Entry 6: Assignment 6 -->
    <h3>Assignment 6: Plan a React To-Do List</h3>
    <h4>November 16, 2023 </h4>

    <img class="drawTree" src="./ReactMockUp.jpeg" alt="Assignment 6 React Mockup">

    <p>
        For step one I created the mockup drawn above in dark navy blue. For step one I broke that mockup into the anticipated components. 
        The green box outlines the overall application which is the searchable and filterable to-do list. Next the pink box outlines 
        the search/filter bar. The orange outlines the add task component. The light purple outlines the overall task list. Each task 
        is outlined in red. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The search/filter component will dictate the order in which the to-dos are displayed in the task list. The add component will 
        also affect the task list as it can add new items to the task list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next I moved to step three to find my state. To find my minimal state I walked through the questions in the reading to determine 
        what the state variables are. I determined that the state variables are the search text box and the filter checkboxes. These components 
        change over time and are not able to be computed from other things. They also affect other aspects of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The add button and filtered/unfiltered task list are not state. The add button itself does not change over time. The task list might 
        change overtime but it is computed from other properties (props) that are passed down to it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For step four I needed to determine where my state would live. Given the information above, I believe that the state should sit in the search/filter 
        component that is outlined in pink. This would be able to pass state down to the task list items with the larger task list.
    </p>
