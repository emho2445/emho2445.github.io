            <p>My name is Emma Hopson and I am a fourth year undergraduate in Creative Technology and Design (CTD) within the College of Engineering and Applied Science. 
                My CTD focus is on UI/UX design and application development such as websites and mobile apps. Alongside my degree I will be completing the Leadership Studies 
                Minor as well as the Engineering Leadership Certificate. I am currently a part of the Engineering Leadership Program as a fellow where I am doing research 
                into how middle-tier leaders within organizations handle pressures from above and below and apply effective leadership strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the last three and a half years I have worked for NASA Colorado Space Grant Consortium here at CU Boulder. I am currently the Program Manager for the 
                Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone (GLEE) and was previously GLEE's Global Stem Engagement Lead. This project has sparked my interest in engineering project management. 
                After graduation I will be going into the sustainable energy industry and be working on ways to implement and automate sustainable energy into our power grid.
            </p>

                In my free time I enjoy spending time outdoors and with friends, particularly skiing. I have recently been getting into alpine touring but also enjoy long days at 
                the resort with friends. I have also begun to climb and enjoy indoor climbing. In the summer I love going on adventures either backpacking or four-wheeling with my Jeep. 
                Although, in my free time I am most likely to be found playing with my bunny, Boo.
