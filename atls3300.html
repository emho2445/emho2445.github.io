    <h2 id="Assignment4">Lab 4: Analog Input</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this lab I experiment with the analog pins on the Arduino Uno by using a potentiometer.
        I use a combination of analog and digital pins on the board to create LEDs that respond to different inputs from the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
        <li>USB Cable</li>
        <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
        <li>220 ohm Resistors</li>
        <li>LEDs</li>
        <li>Potentiometer (10k)</li>
        <li>Joystick Module</li>
        <li>Breadboard Jumper Wire (Male to Male and Male to Female)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Using a Potentiometer</h4>
    <p>For the first part of this lab I set up a circuit with the Arduino Uno and a potentiometer. 
        I used Lecture 5, slide 19 to set up this circuit. Below is a photo of the circuit and a schematic of it as well.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part1_Circuit.jpeg" alt="Schematic">
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part1_ActualCircuit.JPG" alt="Physical Circuit">
    <p>Next I used the Arduino IDE to program a sketch that reads out the analog values of the potentiometer. 
        The values for our potentiometer are going to be between 0 and 1023. I used the function <strong>analogRead()</strong> of 
        the pin to get the correct values. 
    </p>

    </video>

    <h4>Part 2: Light 'em Up With A Potentiometer</h4>
    <p>For the next step in this lab I created a breadboard with five different LED circuits and the same circuit with the potentiometer. 
        The goal is to have a different number of LED lights turn on depending on the range of the potentiometer. Below is a photo of the 
        circuit used in this part. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part2_circuit.JPG" alt="LED Circuit">
    <p>To make the code easier to understand I used the <strong>map()</strong> function to map the analog values of the potentiometer to 
        6 different states (since we have five LEDs and the off state). You can see this in line 30 of the code below. Then I used a series 
        of if, else if statements to output the correct pins that will turn on the correct number of LEDs.
    </p>

    </video>

    <h4>Part 3: Joystick For Arduino</h4>
    <p>Now I am going to hook up a joystick to the Arduino. This joystick has two different potentiometers and a push button. To hook it up to the 
        Arduino Uno I used male to female wires and plugged it into the 5V, ground, A0, A1 and digital 9 pin. Below is the circuit with the joystick attached. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part3_Circuit.JPG" alt="Joystick Circuit">
    <p>To see what the readings are on the joystick I created an Arduino sketch to see what it was outputting. I used the <strong>analogRead()</strong> 
        function to get the value of the analog pin in the loop. When the joystick is in the following positions it gives the following outputs formatted like (x,y): 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Centered: (495, 515)</li>
        <li>Left: (0, 515)</li>
        <li>Right: (1023, 515)</li>
        <li>Down: (495, 1023)</li>
        <li>Up: (495, 0)</li>
        <li>Up to the Right: (1023, 0)</li>
        <li>Up to the Left: (0, 0)</li>
        <li>Down to the Right: (1023, 1023)</li>
        <li>Down to the Left: (0, 1023)</li>
    </ul>

    </video>

    <h4>Part 4: Light 'em Up With a Joystick</h4>
    <p>In this part I kept the joystick and rearranged the LED circuits so that they would be in the shape of a plus (+). Each LED is still connected to a 
        digital pin on the Arduino Uno. Below is a photo of the breadboard and circuit. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab4/Part4_Circuit.JPG" alt="Joystick LED Circuit">
    <p>Next, I wanted to turn on the LED corresponding to the direction of the joystick. For my circuit I wanted the white one in the center on if the joystick 
        was at rest, the red one on when the joystick was pushed up, green for the right, yellow for down and blue for the left. To do this I needed to create 
        different conditions for the different joystick positions. I mapped the x and y potentiometer analog readings between -2 and 2 for the different positions. 
        Then I used a series of if-statements to test which direction the joystick was. If the condition was met then the LED corresponding to the position would turn on. 
        The code below is commented as well so you can follow along with it. 
    </p>

        <source src="img/objectlab/Lab4/Part4_Video.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 5: Basic LED Whack-A-Mole</h4>
    <p>For the final part of this lab I put all of the above concepts together to create a whack-a-mole style game with LEDs! First I created the user interface by 
        printing out “Get Ready!” and blinking the center LED twice. From there I put the code in a for loop that will run 20 times to create 20 rounds in the game and started a timer.
    </p>
    <p>I needed to create a boolean value to see if the LED in the game is on or not. This is used later in the code to loop through a while loop until the player moves the joystick in the correct direction.</p>
    <p>From there I used the random number created to turn one of the LEDs on at random. Then in the while loop I take in the values from the joystick and test to see if they correspond to 
        the correct state. In order to turn off the LED and move out of the while loop the position of the joystick and random LED must match up. 
    </p>
    <p>When all 20 iterations of the game are completed I take the end time and outputted the gamer's time and a message that says the game is over. The code below is also commented to make it easier to read.</p>

    <!-- Lab 3 -->

    <h2 id="Assignment3">Lab 3: "I came, I saw, I soldered"</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this lab I learned how to solder both stranded and solid-core wires to a Protoboard. </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Protoboard</li>
        <li>Stranded Wire</li>
        <li>Solid-core Wire</li>
        <li>Soldering Iron</li>
        <li>Lead-free, rosin core Solder Wire</li>
        <li>Fume Extractor</li>
        <li>Brass Wire Pad</li>
        <li>Soldering Helping Hands</li>
        <li>Solder Sucker Desoldering Pump</li>
        <li>Solder Wick</li>
        <li>Wire Stripper with Wire Cutter</li>
        <li>Safety Glasses (Regular glasses in my case)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Soldering Setup and Safety</h4>
    <p>Since I was unable to do the lab in the BTU lab, I created my own soldering station at home. 
        First I laid down a mat so no solder would get on the table. Next I set up the fume extractor to suck up any fumes 
        that come from the soldering iron. The soldering iron was then set up with the brass pad for cleaning the tip of 
        the soldering iron.
    </p>
    <p>
        When working with a soldering iron it is really important to use proper safety. I always wash my hands both 
        before and after working since residue will get on your hands. I wore my glasses to protect my eyes from any splatter 
        that might occur. I also wore a mask while working with the iron so as to not inhale any toxic fumes and protect my face. 
        I made sure that the area was well lit and had lots of space for the lab. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/Workspace.JPG" alt="Soldering Workspace">

    <h4>Part 2: Soldering Wires to Protoboard</h4>
    <p>To begin I started with tinning and cleaning the tip of my iron. I used a small amount of solder and the brass pad to clean the tip of the iron. </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/CleanedTip.JPG" alt="Tinned and Cleaned Tip">
    <p>Now I began to solder the wires to the board. First I had to cut the red, stranded wire to be four inches. I stripped about 2 millimeters 
        off of each end of the wire. I started in the corner of the board with one end and then went four spaces over to attach the other end of the wire. 
        Next I did the same for two, four inch white, solid-core wires in different rows. Below is a picture of all three wires connected. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/WiresBottom.JPG" alt="Wires Soldered to Protoboard">
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/WiresTop.JPG" alt="Wires Soldered to Protoboard">
    <p>I found that soldering the stranded wire to the Protoboard was much easier than the solid-core. The stranded wire has more surface 
        area that would attach to the Protoboard. The solid-core wire did not like to hold in the solder as well which made it hard to get a good joint. 
    </p>

    <h4>Part 3: Bridge of Solder</h4>
    <p>For this part of the lab I created three different traces that connected the wires together. This takes two different joints and connects them together 
        on the Protoboard. Below is a picture of the traces that I created.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab3/Traces.JPG" alt="Protoboard Traces">

    <h4>Part 4: Splicing Wires</h4>
    <p>In this part of the lab I practiced splicing wires together. First I cut the stranded wire into four, two inch pieces. Then I used the wire stripper to 
        strip about 2 millimeters off of each end of the wires. Next, I used the helping hands and put two wires in an alligator clip. I put a little bit of solder 
        on one side of each of the wires. Then I positioned them so that the sides with the solder were touching. When I placed the soldering iron on the joint the 
        solder from each wire melted together. I repeated this process for attaching the other two wires. Below is a picture of the joints and the final wire. 
    </p>

    <!-- Lab 2 -->
    <h2 id="Assignment2">Lab 2: React-I/O-n</h2>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This week's lab builds upon the simple circuitry from last week. I used the Arduino IDE to program the LED and button. For the final part of this lab 
        I built a game that times how fast it takes to hit the button. 
    </p>

    <h3>Materials Used</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arduino Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
            <li>USB Cable to connect the Board to my laptop</li>
            <li>Button</li>
            <li>830 Tie-Points Breadboard</li>
            <li>Breadboard Jumper Wires</li>
            <li>2 100 Ohm Resistors and 1 10k Ohm Resistor</li>
            <li>LED</li>
            <li>Multimeter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <h4>Part 1: Setting Up The Arduino IDE</h4>
    <p>For part 1 I set up the Arduino IDE for this board. Since I already had Arduino installed I 
        just had to make sure that the correct board and port were selected. For more information visit
         the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino website</a> for details on how to install the IDE. 
    </p>
    <p>For this lab I was using an Arduino Uno board plugged into the Comm Port 3. I used the UART to USB cable to 
        connect the board to my laptop. The connection went to Port 3. It's important to select both the correct Port and board
         under "Tools", if you don't then the code will not upload properly.
    </p>
    <p>To test if the board was connected properly I uploaded the Blink code from the example library. Since I set it up right, the 
         Arduino LED blinked every second as seen below.
    </p>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="BlinkingArduinoBoard">
        <source src=".\img\objectlab\Lab2\Lab2_BlinkVideo_Part1.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 2: Blinking an External LED</h4>
    <p>For the second part of this Lab I blinked an external LED on the 830 Tie-Points Breadboard. To do this I used the <strong>digitalWrite()</strong> 
        function in the Arduino IDE. When the LED is set to <strong>“LOW”</strong> that means that it is not getting any voltage and when it is set to <strong>“HIGH”</strong> 
        it is getting voltage. 
    </p>
    <p>In the <Strong>loop()</Strong> portion of the script I added a <strong>digitalWrite()</strong> function to set the LED pin to HIGH so that it turns on the LED. 
        Then I wrote a <strong>delay()</strong> statement that delayed the loop function by 1000 milliseconds or 1 second. Next, I called <strong>digitalWrite()</strong> again to set 
        the LED pin to <strong>LOW</strong> which turns off the LED. After that I used <strong>delay()</strong> again to delay the loop for another 1000 milliseconds. This makes the 
        LED turn on for a second then turn off for a second. 
    </p>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="BlinkingExternalLED">
        <source src="img\objectlab\Lab2\Blink2.MOV">
    </video>
    <p>
        It is fun to change around some of the parameters to see what happens. Below I changed the <strong>delay()</strong> function to blink on for three seconds then off for three seconds. 
        I also did one where the LED blinks every 100 milliseconds.
    </p>

        <source src="img/objectlab/Lab2/SlowBlink3.MOV">
    </video>

    <h4>Part 3: Button Press and Serial Monitor</h4>
    <p>Next I wanted to add a button to the circuit that will change what the LED does. 
        First I added a pin that takes an input, which is the button. We can use the <strong>digitalRead()</strong> function to see what the input pin is set to. If it is HIGH that means the pin has power 
        and if it is LOW then the pin does not have voltage.
    </p>
    <p>The circuit I created is a pull-down resistor circuit where there is a 10 kilo-ohm resistor connected to the ground pin which helps regulate the voltage and current coming from the 5V 
        pin to the input pin. Below is a picture of the circuit along with a Fritzing schematic (wire colors match) which might be easier to follow. 
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab2/Circuit4.jpg" alt="Pull-down Resistor Circuit" >
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab2/FritzingCircuit.jpg" alt="Fritzing Circuit Diagram">
    <p>Next I worked with the serial monitor to test that the pin was reading the button input. Using the function <strong>Serial.println()</strong> you can print to the serial monitor. 
        To get familiar with the serial monitor I created the sketch below to print “Arduino Uno says Hello”. To set up the sketch I set the baud rate to 9600 using <strong>Serial.begin()</strong> in the 
        <strong>setup()</strong> function. Then in the <strong>loop()</strong> section I used <strong>Serial.println(“Arduino Uno says Hello!”)</strong> to print to the serial monitor.
    </p>
    <img class="labimg2" src="/img/objectlab/Lab2/HelloPrint.jpg" alt="Hello World Code" width="800">
    <p>Now it is time to combine these concepts to create a program that prints to the serial monitor when the button is pressed and says “waiting” when the button is not pressed. Below is the code used for this process:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/fb9dde20e896fd55f5f65d0db1fe0463.js"></script>
    <p>First I initialized the pin that the button is connected to. I also initialized a boolean variable that will later store if the “waiting” message was sent. Then, in the <strong>setup()</strong> function I declared the 
        button as an input pin. It is also important to set the baud rate for the serial monitor using <strong>Serial.begin()</strong>. Now in the <strong>loop()</strong> function I need to create an if-statement to check if 
        the button is pressed or not. The first one checks if the button is not being pressed and the “waiting” message has not been sent then we need to print “waiting” to the serial monitor and change the boolean to true 
        since the message has now been sent. The next if-statement checks if the button is pressed. If it is then we print “success” to the serial monitor and reset the boolean variable to false since we now want it to send 
        the “waiting” message next time the button is not pressed. Below is the video of this working. (Please note that I had a 4 second delay in my loop so that is why the serial monitor is printing slower since it is not looping as fast)
    </p>
    <video controls muted width="800" height="500" name="SerialMonitor">
        <source src="img/objectlab/Lab2/ButtonPressed5.MOV">
    </video>
    <p>Since I added the delay the oscillation in the button was not apparent.</p>
    


    <h4>Part 4: LED Reaction Game</h4>
    <p>For Part 4 I created a reaction game that times the player between when the LED turns on and when they press the button. Below is the code that I used to create this:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/emho2445/baeb17769ee0ae4504c58d093fe544b2.js"></script>
    <p>I start by initializing the LED pin and the button (input) pin. Now in the <strong>setup()</strong> function I declare the LED pin to be an output pin and the button pin 
        to be an input pin. Next I set the baud rate to 9600 to set up the serial monitor. I put the welcome message in the set up because I only wanted it to print once while 
        the player is playing the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <strong>loop()</strong> function I first have the message “ready” to prepare the user that the game has started. Next I use the <strong>random(min, max)</strong> function 
        to create a random number between 500 and 5000 that is stored in the integer <strong>randNumber</strong>. Then I delay by the number of milliseconds that randNumber holds. Then the 
        LED turns on after that random amount of time. When the LED turns on the time is taken using the <strong>millis()</strong> function and stored to a time variable. Next we go into a 
        “stalling” while loop that will run as long as the button is not pressed. Since we do not want anything to happen except time pass while we wait for the player to hit the button, 
        the while loop is empty. As soon as the button is pressed the <strong>INPUT_PIN</strong> has a value of <strong>HIGH </strong>and breaks the while loop and meets the conditions 
        for the if-statement. The time is taken again the moment the button is pressed. The LED is then turned off, resetting it for the next round. Then I print out the time in milliseconds 
        that it took for the player to hit the button. Outside of the if-statement the game/loop is reset in the serial monitor by printing “Game Restarting” and giving the player 5 seconds 
        to get ready. It will then loop back to the loop where it prints out “ready”. Below is a video of me playing the game!

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step in this lab was to set up power to the breadboard. I attached the power supply module to the breadboard so that
            one column of the board would be 5 volts and the other side would be 3.3 volts. Below are pictures of the multimeter reading out 5 
            volts and on the other side 3.3 volts: <br>

        </li> <br>

        <li>Next I created a simple circuit that consisted of a 9 volt battery, a 100 ohm resistor, a blue LED and wires to connect them.
             For this circuit I used the 3.3V side of the breadboard. <br>

             <!-- Insert image of simple circuit and schematic -->
        </li><br>

        <li>Next I created the same simple circuit but used the 5 volt source. Since the voltage was higher I needed to use a different 
            resistor to make sure the current was within range. I found that the resistor needs to be at least ______ ohms so I just used 
            two 100 ohm resistors in series with each other. <br>

        </li><br>

        <li>
            After this I incorporated a momentary switch into the circuit in series with the LED and resistor. When adding the button the 
            LED will only turn on when the button is pressed. This is because the button creates a break in the circuit when not pressed, 
            this does not allow current to flow. When the button is pressed the circuit is connected and current can flow freely. <br>

        </li><br>

        <li>For the extra credit assignment we had to get the button to work in reverse: the light turned off when the button was pressed. 
            To do this I made the button and LED in parallel with each other. The 100 ohm resistor is in series with each loop in the parallel 
            circuit so that no matter which direction current flows it has to go through the resistor. The reason that the button works opposite 
            from when it was in series is because of the way current flows through parallel circuits. The LED can be thought of as a very small 
            resistor in a circuit. The button, when pressed, can be thought of as a wire with negligible resistance. When current gets to the junction 
            where it either goes to the LED (acting like a resistor) or through the button (acting like a wire) it chooses the “path of least resistance” 
            and the current goes through the button instead of the branch with the LED. When the button is not pressed then that loop is a broken circuit 
            and no current can flow through that branch causing all of it to go to the LED. <br>
